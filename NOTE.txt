A FEW THINGS TO NOTE:

	On the third question the second pump we used was acting bad. 
(see Arduino comments under question 3 code for detail)

	The final 3rd question data ("Pro3Data3.txt") 
reflect the bad pump rather than the good one, 
because it was the pump we were checked off with for questions 2 and 3.

	The figure used for question 3 ("Proj3Fig3.jpg") and ("Proj3Fig3.m")
is the original pump's data, as it better reflects proper conditions.

After the bad pump, we used the good pump again with some success, it was jumpy, but it was within a good range.
Though it still was not as good as the first.
So, this has been included with the data as "Proj3Data3B.txt", the produced figure can be found by using the matlab program, 
and uncommenting lines marked "%q3B".

As such, the Arduino code "FINALPROJ3.ino" has values that reflect the newest run (named 3B)
The Bad run values can be used by uncommenting lines with "Reflects bad pump" and commenting the new values
and can be used in place of their new values.

SUMMARY: 3B DOES NOT stand for 3 Bad.
	There were 3 versions of question 3. Original, 3 Bad, and 3B.

	Data for original was lost.
	Graph/figure for original is labeled "Proj3Fig3.jpg"/"Proj3Fig3.m" 
	THIS IS THE BEST ONE.
	
	Data for Bad was labeled "Pro3Data3.txt"
	Graph/figure was not kept.

	Data for 3B is labeled "Pro3Data3B.txt"
	Graph/figure for 3B was labeled "Proj3Fig3B.m"
